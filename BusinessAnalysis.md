5. Preliminary operational concept of proposed system

    5.1 Preliminary operational concept

        a) operational policies and constraints;
            The system shall save data without internet access
            The system shall accept user inputs for its data.
            The system shall require a log in to access and modify data

        b) description of the proposed system;
            The software will allow for the storage of client and store data. While also keeping track of customer preferences and store orders. The software should 
            also have a built in calander to allow user to see upcoming appointments and dates. Finally the software should allow users to complete client appointments 
            and keep track of employee hours worked.

        c) modes of system operation;
            The system shall run on windows desktops and laptops.

        d) user classes and other involved personnel.
            While more may be added in the future there will be two user classes: Owner, employee and software developer. 

        e) support environment.
             The system shall run with windows 11.
             The system shall be supported with periodic updates and maintinence for 2 or more years after its completion.

    5.2 Preliminary operational scenarios
    
        scenario 1: User logs into system and signs in with their name and password. User is identifed as an employee and opens into the home page. From the homepage 
          the employee is able to edit their client's information and add new appointments for those clients but be unable to edit other employee's client information. 
          The employee should be able to view the calender to see upcoming dates and appointments for their and other employees clients. Finally the employee should be 
          able to complette client appointments and submit how many hours they worked for a given day.
        
        scenario 2: User logs into system and signs in with their name and password. User is identifed as the owner and opens into the home page. From the home page
          the owner is able to use all the same features as an employee but is able to edit their employee's appiontments, client information and place/view orders for           products the salon needs. The owner shall also be able to create new clients and access employee information. The owner should also be able to view the                 calender and edit/create appointment information on said calender. Finally, the owner can access employee payment information and see how long they have
          worked.
        
        
        scenario 3: User logs into system and signs in with their name and password. User is identifed as the software developer and opens into the home page. The                developer or dev shall be able to access the programs main code and update it with new features of bug fixes. The developer should not have access to                  employee or client information but instead have access to a mock version to allow for testing of new features. 
        
6. Other preliminary life-cycle concepts

    6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept
        The system soulution will be acquired from consisent meetings with the client where the dev and client shall go over and create requriment based on what the
        client needs and what is possible for the developer to do. Production will start in the fall as defining the requriments has only just begun. Some requirments         will be created based on the salon's previous software SalonIris.

    6.2 Preliminary deployment concept
        The software shall be delivered initally via download and after a trial period of one month, offically adopted by the salon.

    6.3 Preliminary support concept
        After inital delivery the software will be supported for two or more years after the salon adopts the software. Updates will be downloaded online with the             owner's approval and the owner can email or call the dev if any issues arise with the software inbetween updates.

    6.4 Preliminary retirement concept
        The software will be retired by the deletion of all user accounts and client information. Then the software will be uninstalled from the salon's main computer.
        Finally, its replacment will installed and launched after the old software is removed.

7. Project Constraints
    The project will not be started untill fall of next year due to the main devloper being busy with an internship and other school work. So the coding of the project     will have a time limit of only one year.
